# Powerful Questions Card Deck

This is a card deck of **powerful questions** that Openscapes mentors use as part of our coaching skills. 
We use these questions as tools as we support colleagues learning new skills to make our work more collaborative, reproducible, and transparent. 

What do we mean by a “powerful question”? It’s a short question that can open up a really powerful conversation. It’s open-ended, usually starts with the word “What”, ideally is 5 words or less, and can’t be answered by yes or no. What feels like success to you? What’s in the way? What, if anything, is going unsaid? Which of your core values is being messed with?

Please enjoy digitally, or print [suggestion coming soon].

Openscapes Mentors develop coaching skills that can help us as professionals – skills like listening rather than solutioneering, asking open-ended questions that empower people to find their own agency and meet their needs.
